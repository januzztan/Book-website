Booktstore website linked to a local MySQL database, allows for creating, reading, updating and deleting items in the database through the webpage.

I used Node.js to interact with MySQL local database and React.js for the frontend of the website.

The main functions of the websites are adding a new book to the database, viewing all books, updating individual books and deleting individual books.

The fields adjustable for the books include the title, description, price and cover image.
